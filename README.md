# Container Orchestration with Kubernetes

This tutorial will get you up and running with a Kubernetes cluster in less than 10 mins. You must have SSH access to at least two cloud instances (AWS, Digital Ocean, etc.) or on-premises computers (e.g., a laptop and a Raspberry Pi on the same network) to successfully get through these instructions.

## 1. Introduction

We will be using the "k3s" certified Kubernetes distribution by Rancher. It is a lightweight version of the more fully featured Kubernetes "k8s" originally designed by Google. The k3s version is meant to be used by resouce-constrained hardware like ARM single-board computers with limited RAM. A big advantage is that it is a smaller software distribution that is much easier to install.
